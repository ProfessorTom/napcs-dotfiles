# StashIt wraps the 'wget' command and puts files
# in my ~/Dropbox/stashit folder. It's just something
# simple but it makes my life easier because I can name
# the file myself.
#
# Example:
#
# stashit cat_hates_you http://i.imgur.com/ZCd5N.png
#
# I can put it in a subfolder too
#
# stashit cat_hates_you http://i.imgur.com/ZCd5N.png pics/funny/cat_pictures
#
# Installation:
#
# Save this file as 'stashit' and then make it executable.
#
# $ chmod +x stashit
